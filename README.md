Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses React Js a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components, to implement the business owner panel. 

- This project uses the React Native an open-source UI software framework created by Meta Platforms. It is used to develop applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows and UWP by enabling developers to use the React framework along with native platform capabilities.

- For persistent storage (database), the website and application uses the phpmyadmin software tools,intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web, and supports a wide range of operations on MySQL, for controlling, and organizing data. 

- To get the user location, the website and application uses geo location a package used to get the longitude and latitude of the user.

- To show the number of feedback, discount in a specific periode of time, the webiste uses rechart package, used to write charts in React applications.
